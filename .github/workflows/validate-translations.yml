            Your changes have caused translation validation to fail. This usually means:
            
            - Missing translation keys in one or more language files
            - Extra keys that don't exist in the English reference
            - Empty translation values
            
            Please run \`npm run validate-translations\` locally to see the specific issues and fix them before merging.
            
            üí° **Pro tip**: Use the English translation file (\`src/locales/en/translation.json\`) as your reference for the correct structure.`
